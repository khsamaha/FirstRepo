Content
The dataset contains 135 181 events. GED 17.1 is a global dataset that covers the entirety of the Globe (excluding Syria) between 1989-01-01 and 2016-12-31.
The maximum (best) spatial resolution of the dataset is the individual village or town. The dataset is fully geocoded. The maximum (best) temporal resolution of the dataset is the day.

Only events linkable to a UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict, a UCDP Non-State Conflict or a UCDP One-Sided Violence instance are included. Events are included for the entire period, i.e. both for the years when such conflicts were active and for the years when such conflicts where not active.

UCDP GED 17.1 is compatible with the 17.1 series of UCDP datasets

The UCDP GED 17.1 is (mostly) backwards compatible with UCDP GED versions 1.0-5.0. Check the compatibility notes below for further details. Significant changes have been made in the actor, dyad and actor/side id meaning these identifiers are no longer backwards compatible.
